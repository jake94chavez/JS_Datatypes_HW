// Selecting Datatypes

// 1. I would use a boolean. lightOn = true; for example.
// 2. String. email = "user.email@website.com"
// 3. Object. const spaceship = {hull: carbon fiber, weapons: "laser blasters", tools: ["tractor beam", "warp drive"]}
// 4. Array. const students = ["Jake", "Other Student", "etc.", "etc."]
// 5. Array of objects. const students = [{name: "Jake", location: "bar"}, {name: "Other Student", location:"home"}]
// 6. Array of objects with a nested array. const students = [{name: "Jake", location: "bar", favShows: ["Game of Thrones", "Adventure Time", "Could keep listing shows like this"]}, {name: "Other Student", location:"home" favShows: ["The Voice", "Insert popular television program here"]}]


// Take It Easy

const rainbow = ["Red", "Orange", "Yellow", "Green", "Blue", "Indigo", "Violet"]

rainbow[4] //would access blue

const jake = {
	favFood: "Spaghetti and Meatballs",
	hobby: "Watching television",
	town: "Cedar Park",
	favDataType: "Objects",
}

jake.hobby;
